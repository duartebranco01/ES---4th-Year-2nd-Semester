This code was developed as part of a large group project. The project concisted of the development of a Wifi Switch. This is my part of the work.
This code sets up the microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico W) as an acessed point to insert Wifi credentials, then it connects to wifi.
It triggers a relay to connect on/off a switch by reading a physical button, or with an Android App.
It also receives activation schedules via the Android App so it syncs time with a NTP server.
